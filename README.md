ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Sameer Dey, a passionate educator who loves sharing knowledge both online and offline. With a background in teaching, I've had the privilege of guiding over 1000 students through various learning platforms and in-person sessions.

ðŸ’» As a seasoned full stack developer, I bring expertise in a range of programming languages, including Python, C, C++, and JavaScript. My journey in software development has equipped me with hands-on experience in building robust web applications and honing my skills across the entire stack.

ðŸŽ“ Teaching is not just a profession for me; it's a calling. I find immense joy in simplifying complex concepts, fostering a love for learning, and empowering students to reach their full potential. Whether it's through structured courses, one-on-one mentoring, or engaging workshops, I strive to make learning an enjoyable and enriching experience.

ðŸš€ Alongside teaching, I also delve into freelancing projects, leveraging my technical skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to exciting ventures. This side hustle allows me to stay updated with industry trends, collaborate with diverse teams, and continuously sharpen my expertise.
